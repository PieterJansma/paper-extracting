Extract the following fields from the paper. If a field cannot be determined, return null (single value) or [] (lists).

- pid:
  Main persistent identifier of the study (usually the DOI "10.xxxx/...").
  If several DOIs, pick the main study DOI. If none, use another clear registration ID. Otherwise null.

- study_name:
  Name of the study or cohort (e.g. "Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children").
  Prefer the named cohort/study over the article title.

- study_acronym:
  Explicit acronym of the study (e.g. "ALSPAC", "UK Biobank"). If none, null.

- study_types:
  High-level labels for the design. Use any of:
  "Biobank", "Cohort study", "Clinical trial", "Registry", "Network", "Other type".
  You may return more than one.

- cohort_type:
  If it is a cohort study, return a short subtype such as:
  "birth cohort", "prospective cohort", "retrospective cohort",
  "population-based cohort", "hospital-based cohort", "longitudinal cohort".
  Otherwise null.

- website:
  Public website URL of the study/biobank, if given (e.g. "https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk").
  If none, null.

- start_year / end_year:
  Years when recruitment or baseline data collection started and ended.
  If recruitment is ongoing, end_year = null.
  If only one year is given, set both to that year.
  If unclear, both null.

- contact_email:
  Main contact or study email (or corresponding author if that is all that is given).
  If none, null.

- n_included:
  Number of participants in the final analytic cohort.
  Exclude invited, screened, or eligible-but-not-included counts.
  If unclear, null.

- countries:
  List of COUNTRIES of the included participants.
  Only sovereign states, e.g. "Netherlands", "the Netherlands", "Germany", "United Kingdom".
  Do not put cities or regions here. Deduplicate.

- regions:
  List of subnational areas where participants were recruited, e.g.:
  "Dutch municipality of Coevorden", "Bristol area of the UK", "Greater London".
  Do not put plain country names here. Deduplicate.

- inclusion_criteria:
  Main medical/health-related or role-based inclusion criteria.
  Use short, specific phrases where possible. Examples:
  - "pelvic floor symptoms"
  - "pregnant women"
  - "community-dwelling adults"
  - "general practice patients"
  - "prostate cancer survivors"
  Return a LIST and include multiple items if clearly stated. If no clear inclusion conditions, return [].

- other_inclusion_criteria:
  Additional non-age, non-location eligibility details that are not already captured in inclusion_criteria.
  Examples:
  - "able to provide informed consent"
  - "registered at participating general practices"
  - "attending outpatient urology clinic"
  Use short phrases. If none, return [].

- exclusion_criteria:
  Explicit conditions that make people ineligible.
  Examples:
  - "terminal illness"
  - "cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia)"
  - "current psychological condition precluding informed consent"
  - "previous pelvic surgery"
  Do not include age or location here. If none, return [].

- other_exclusion_criteria:
  Broader or catch-all exclusions that are less specific.
  Examples:
  - "serious comorbidity"
  - "unable to comply with follow-up"
  - "considered unsuitable to participate by the GP"
  Use short phrases. If none, return [].

- population_age_group:
  Short description of age eligibility or follow-up range, e.g.:
  "16+ years", "18–65 years", "birth to 18 years", "adults".
  Avoid degenerate ranges like "18–18 years" unless that is explicit.
  If unclear, null.

- clinical_study_types:
  Short natural-language descriptions (3–15 words) summarising the study design.

  Examples:
    - "prospective hospital-based cohort study"
    - "retrospective observational cohort study"
    - "randomised controlled clinical trial"
    - "cross-sectional prevalence survey"
    - "case-control study"
    - "systematic review and meta-analysis"

  Use the design terminology found in the paper. Typical cues include:
    prospective, retrospective, observational, cross-sectional, longitudinal,
    hospital-based, population-based, biobank, data-biobank, registry, cohort,
    trial, randomised, single-arm, pragmatic, case-control.

  IMPORTANT (strong rules):
  - If the paper contains ANY of these design cues, you MUST return at least
    one study design phrase summarising the design.
  - Combine multiple cues if present (e.g., “prospective observational
    hospital-based data-biobank”).
  - You MAY return more than one phrase.
  - Return [] ONLY when the paper provides absolutely no study design
    information at all (this is rare).

Extract the following fields from the paper. If a field cannot be determined, return null (single value) or [] (lists).

- pid:
  Main persistent identifier of the study (usually the DOI "10.xxxx/...").
  If several DOIs, pick the main study DOI. If none, use another clear registration ID. Otherwise null.

- study_name:
  Name of the study or cohort (e.g. "Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children").
  Prefer the named cohort/study over the article title.

- study_acronym:
  Explicit acronym of the study (e.g. "ALSPAC", "UK Biobank"). If none, null.

- study_types:
  High-level labels for the design. Use any of:
  "Biobank", "Cohort study", "Clinical trial", "Registry", "Network", "Other type".
  You may return more than one.

- cohort_type:
  If it is a cohort study, return a short subtype such as:
  "birth cohort", "prospective cohort", "retrospective cohort",
  "population-based cohort", "hospital-based cohort", "longitudinal cohort".
  Otherwise null.

- website:
  Public website URL of the study/biobank, if given (e.g. "https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk").
  If none, null.

- start_year / end_year:
  Determine the years when actual participant recruitment or baseline
  inclusion started and ended.

  - start_year:
    Use the first clear year when inclusion or data collection began.

  - end_year:
    Only assign a value if the paper explicitly states that inclusion
    STOPPED in that year (e.g. “recruited between 2014–2018”).
    If the paper describes recruitment as ongoing, active, or continuing,
    set end_year = null.

    IMPORTANT:
    - Do NOT use projected or expected future targets (e.g. “expected
      to reach 10,000 participants by 2025”) as end_year.
    - Do NOT use follow-up end dates, analysis dates, or publication
      years as end_year unless they also clearly indicate the end of
      inclusion.

  If only a single start year is given and no recruitment stop year
  is described, set start_year = that year and end_year = null.

- contact_email:
  Main contact or study email (or corresponding author if that is all that is given).
  If none, null.

- n_included:
  Number of participants in the final analytic cohort.
  Exclude invited, screened, or eligible-but-not-included counts.
  If unclear, null.

- countries:
  List of COUNTRIES where the participants of THIS study/biobank were actually
  recruited or where they live.

  GOAL:
  Only include countries that clearly belong to this study’s OWN participants.

  RULES:
  - Include ONLY countries where:
      - participants were recruited, or
      - the cohort is based / lives.
  - Ignore countries that are ONLY:
      - comparison cohorts in other countries,
      - background examples in the introduction or discussion,
      - locations of co-author institutions without participants.
  - A place that is a city, region, province or state (e.g. "Bristol", "South West of England", "California")
    MUST NOT be put in countries. These go into regions instead.
  - Use country names or common abbreviations, e.g. "United Kingdom" or "UK".
  - Deduplicate the list.

  EXAMPLES (GENERAL):
  - If the paper says:
      "We recruited participants in the city X in country Y."
    Then:
      countries = ["Y"],
      regions   = ["X"] (if you want to be specific)

  - If the paper says:
      "Our cohort is based in country A. We compare our results to cohorts in countries B and C."
    Then:
      countries = ["A"]
    (B and C are comparison studies only and MUST NOT be included.)

- regions:
  List of subnational areas where participants were recruited, e.g.:
  "South West of England", "Bristol area", "Greater London".

  RULES:
  - Do NOT put plain country names here.
  - Only include areas that clearly describe where THIS study’s participants
    were recruited or live.
  - Cities, regions, or states mentioned alongside recruitment belong here.
  - Deduplicate.

- population_age_group:
  Short description of the age eligibility or main follow-up age range.

  RULES:
  - For pregnancy or birth cohorts where children are followed over time,
    use the full child age span, e.g. "birth to 18 years" or "0–18 years".
    Do NOT collapse this to a single age like "18–18 years".
  - If only a minimum age is given (e.g. "aged 16 years or older"),
    use "16+ years" or "≥16 years".
  - If a bounded adult range is given (e.g. "aged 18–65 years"),
    use that range directly, e.g. "18–65 years".
  - If only broad terms like "adults" or "older adults" are used,
    you may return those terms.
  - If the age range cannot be determined, return null.

Extract ONLY the following fields from the paper. If a field cannot be determined, return [].

GENERAL RULES FOR ALL FIELDS:
- Always return SHORT phrases (typically 3–8 words).
- Do NOT copy whole sentences from the paper.
- Prefer information from methods sections (e.g. Participants, Inclusion criteria, Exclusion criteria, Study design, etc.).
- Only describe THIS study. Ignore text about other cohorts, external registries, or comparison studies.

--------------------------------------------------
INCLUSION_CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------
- inclusion_criteria:
  List ONLY the core disease/condition(s) or essential participant category
  that defines who enters the study, in short phrases.

  Examples of GOOD inclusion_criteria:
    "pregnant women"
    "children born to enrolled pregnancies"
    "patients with cancer"
    "patients with a genetically increased risk of cancer"
    "community-dwelling adults"
    "general practice patients"

  RULES:
  - Only include criteria that clearly define WHO can enter THIS study.
  - DO NOT include age information (age belongs in population_age_group).
  - DO NOT include calendar years or time periods.
  - DO NOT include geographic locations (cities, regions, countries).
  - DO NOT include sample sizes, numbers of participants, or follow-up descriptions.
  - Avoid near-duplicates; prefer the simplest clear version.
  - Limit inclusion_criteria to a maximum of 3 distinct phrases.

  HANDLING NUMBERS / LONG DESCRIPTIONS:
  - If a phrase contains numbers (years, counts, ages) but also clearly states
    a participant group, rewrite it to a short generic phrase WITHOUT the numbers.
  - If a phrase only describes changes in numbers or follow-up
    (e.g. “increased to 15 247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years”),
    ignore it completely (do not include it).
  - If several phrases differ only by numbers, dates, or locations, keep only one
    short generic version.

  Examples:
    - "pregnant women in the X area of country Y during 1990–92"
        → "pregnant women"
    - "children from 14 541 pregnancies were recruited between 1990 and 1992"
        → "children born to enrolled pregnancies"
    - "increased to 15 247 pregnancies by the age of 18 years"
        → (ignore: describes numbers, not a new inclusion criterion)

--------------------------------------------------
OTHER_INCLUSION_CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------
- other_inclusion_criteria:
  Non-disease, non-age, non-location eligibility details that are not already
  covered in inclusion_criteria.

  Examples:
    "informed consent obtained"
    "participation in routine care processes"
    "registered at participating practices"
    "able to provide informed consent"

  RULES:
  - DO NOT repeat or restate disease/condition names.
  - DO NOT include age or location.
  - Prefer administrative or procedural phrases.
  - Avoid long lists: merge similar details into 1–2 generic phrases.
  - Limit other_inclusion_criteria to a maximum of 5 phrases.
  - If there are no clear such criteria, return [].

--------------------------------------------------
EXCLUSION_CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------
- exclusion_criteria:
  Explicit conditions that make someone ineligible for THIS study.

  Examples:
    "terminal illness"
    "cognitive impairment (e.g. dementia)"
    "current psychological condition precluding informed consent"
    "previous pelvic surgery"

  RULES:
  - Only include exclusions that are clearly presented as reasons NOT to include
    or NOT to invite participants in THIS study.
  - DO NOT include age or location as exclusions.
  - Use short phrases, not full sentences.
  - It is allowed to include clinical severity or comorbidity if clearly listed
    as an exclusion (e.g. “terminal illness”, “severe heart failure”).
  - If no explicit exclusions are stated anywhere in the paper, return [].

--------------------------------------------------
OTHER_EXCLUSION_CRITERIA
--------------------------------------------------
- other_exclusion_criteria:
  Broader or catch-all exclusions or judgement-based exclusions.

  Examples:
    "serious comorbidity"
    "unable to comply with follow-up"
    "considered unsuitable to participate by the GP"

  RULES:
  - DO NOT repeat exclusions already listed in exclusion_criteria.
  - DO NOT include age or location.
  - Use short, generic phrases.
  - If none are mentioned, return [].

--------------------------------------------------
CLINICAL_STUDY_TYPES
--------------------------------------------------
- clinical_study_types:
  Short natural-language descriptions (3–15 words) summarising the
  study design.

  Examples:
    "prospective hospital-based observational data-biobank"
    "prospective population-based cohort study"
    "randomised controlled clinical trial"
    "case-control study"
    "cross-sectional prevalence survey"

  Use the design cues found in the paper, such as:
    prospective, retrospective, observational, cross-sectional,
    longitudinal, cohort, biobank, data-biobank, registry,
    hospital-based, population-based, randomised, trial,
    case-control.

  RULES:
  - If ANY design cues appear anywhere in the paper, you MUST return at
    least one study design phrase.
  - Combine cues when appropriate (e.g. prospective + observational +
    hospital-based → "prospective observational hospital-based study").
  - Avoid near-duplicates; keep 1–3 clean phrases.
  - Return [] ONLY when truly no design information is present.
